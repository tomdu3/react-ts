## Quiz

1. Where does React put all of the elements I create in JSX when I call `root.render()`?

All the elements I render get put inside the div with the id of "root"
(or whatever other element I might select when calling createRoot)

2. What would show up in my console if I were to run this line of code:

```jsx
console.log(<h1>Hello world!</h1>);
```

An object! Unlike creating an HTML element in vanilla DOM JS, what
gets created from the JSX we have in our React code is a plain JS object
that React will use to fill in the view.

3. What's wrong with this code:

```jsx
root.render(
  <section>
    <h1>Hi there</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
  </section>,
);
```

You can only render 1 parent element at a time. That parent element can have
as many children elements as you want.

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
   _Imperative_ means we need to give specific step-by-step instructions on how to
   accomplish a task.
   _Declarative_ means we can write our code to simply "describe" _what_ should show up
   on the page and allow the rool (React, e.g.) to handle the details on _how_ to
   put those things on the page.

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
   We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
   larger or greater than the individual pieces themselves.
